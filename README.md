# A-Visual-History-of-Nobel-Prize-Winners

Hey There, 

This project is a part of a series of projects on [Datacamp.com](https://learn.datacamp.com/) for Data Science with Python [Career Track](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python?version=5)

It is a guided project offering the datasets and what kind of analysis is needed with them while allowing you to perform the code that executes these functions.

In the End, it offers a series of tests to make sure the output the code generates matches what is expected of the output.

This code tests a dataset of the data produced for stocks prices across different kinds of analysis and offers a comparisson between Amazon and Facebook stocks to offer a recommendation for which stocks to buy

This analysis compares all nobel laureates in terms of the age they won the prize, country, country of birth and the type of prize they won. It offers visual analysis over these types of data to visualize the history of this esteemed prize
